This repository serves as supplementary documentation for the paper: "Entropy Weight Ensemble Framework for Yield Prediction of Winter Wheat Under Different Water Stress Treatments Using Unmanned Aerial Vehicle-Based Multispectral and Thermal Data". DOI:10.3389/fpls.2021.730181

Due to unavailability of the original datasets (resulting from server reconfiguration during institutional transition), the authors have validated the core methodology using independent datasets. The reproduction results confirm the robustness of our original findings. Detailed documentation is provided in the repository files.
